                        <p>Welcome to Hooker &amp; Eight. Our website is under construction and will be fully available very soon. In the mean time why dont you come along and see what we have to offer!</p>
                        <h2 class="heading heading--small">**Stay Alert 2 - Stay Alert with a Vengeance: Public Service announcement**
                        </h2>

                        <p>Hooker & Eight will be launching a delivery and collection service starting from November 5th. This will run throughout our working week (Weds-Sat)</p>

                        <p>Pizzas and Calzones will be cooked three quarters of the way through to be finished in your oven at home (180C for 2-3 minutes or to taste). Chips will not be available for home delivery. </p>

                        <p><strong>Deliveries:</strong></p>

                        <p>We will be taking orders for home delivery between 0600-2030 via the online ordering system and between 0930-2030 via the <a href="tel:01452690829">restaurant phone</a>.</p>

                        <p>IF YOU ARE ORDERING FOR THE SAME DAY PLEASE ORDER BY 1300. </p>

                        <p>This is the cut off point as we will start making the pizzas for delivery and the first batch of deliveries will be on the road by 3pm. Please ensure someone will be home!</p>

                        <p>Unlike last time - our online system will only take order for same day deliveries/collection. Any delivery pre-orders for later in the week MUST be done by telephone!</p>

                        <p>Although the online system will offer you a delivery time, this will be ignored, your pizza will be delivered paper round style between 1500-1800. </p>

                        <p>To reiterate the pizzas will be delivered to your home between 1500-1800. There will be no delivery charge. Just a minimum order of Â£15. The areas that we are delivering to will be found on the online system but we will cover the
                            traditional City of Gloucester with its outlying suburbs.</p>
