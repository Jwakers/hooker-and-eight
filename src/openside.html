                <p>Dan & Balz have teamed up with Gloucester captain, stalwart and all round top boi Lewis Ludlow to take Hooker & Eight Pizzas on road!!</p>

                <p>Ludz has been a Hooker & Eight supporter from the very beginning opening up the restaurant in October 2019. It wasn't long before he approached the boys about taking the pizza out to the people. The opportunity was like a cross-field kick
                    had landed into our hands with the try line beckoning. We grabbed at the chance and Openside Pizza was born!! </p>

                <p> Openside Pizza is a converted horse-box available for any outdoor functions. Whether it be your wedding, birthday, office or house party -, our preemo pizzas will be available for hire! You never know - Lewis might be helping serve and
                    slice and you can twist his ear about the current state of Gloucester's fortunes. He might even bring some friends along ;)  </p>

                <p>The minimum order will be 50 pizzas and we will provide a generous range of our famous Hooker & Eight toppings, sides and dips. We can cater to any taste or dietary requirement (lactose and gluten free options) as well as a fantastic range
                    of vegetarian and vegan options. </p>

                <p>The Openside horse-box is solar powered and self-sustained so no power link ups are required. The horse-box is able to fit on regular sized driveway and requires sensible access to sites. </p>

                <p>Openside Pizza is fully insured and a full allergen list is available upon request.</p>

                <p>To enquire about having Openside Pizza at your event - please email <span class="openside-email"></span> or call Hooker & Eight on <a href="tel:01452690829">01452 690829</a> during opening hours. </p>

                <p>We will see you at a party soon! </p>

                <p>Dan, Balz & Ludz</p>
